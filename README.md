# RFM
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers’:
•	recency (the date they made their last purchase)
•	frequency (how often they make purchases)
•	and monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
To perform RFM analysis using Python, we need a dataset that includes customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts. With this information, we can calculate RFM values for each customer and analyze their patterns and behaviours. I found an ideal dataset for this task.

Conclusion:-
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
